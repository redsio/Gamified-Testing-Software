# Gamified-Testing-Software
A Software Engineering project using JavaScript to simulate a local server and parse text files to run an educational quiz/game about mobile security.

In order to run this file, you will need to have VSCode and the Live Server extension. Open the main folder in VSCode and start a Live Server, and the game should open.

You will start on the list of questions that displays the questions and their correct answers. At the bottom are two buttons for test mode and review mode. Review mode will not have any content until after you play the game at least once.

When running the game, use WASD to move and attack the monsters. When you touch a monster, you will be given a random question from the list you saw before. Submitting a correct answer will delete the monster, and the wrong answer will make you take damage, leaving the monster there. You can try the same monster again, but the question will be random.

After the game is complete, you can go to review mode to see the specific questions that you answered incorrectly.

The user's best score is saved for future sessions.
